## Irasshaimase, Min'na - Welcome to Kawaii Review!
Does this ever happen to you?
You go to leave feedback on a teammate's PR, but normal words just DON'T convey how _sugoi_ or _kowai_ it is?
**Kawaii Review to the rescue!**
Kawaii Review gives you the typical comments you'd leave on a PR, but with all of the sparkle and flare of Japanese emoticons!
♡ (≧◡≦) Scroll through the options below to find the _perfect_ emoticon to copy, and start making those Kawaii Reviews! (≧◡≦) ♡
Brought to you by Chris, Hana, and Lindsey - a.k.a. the **☆ ♡ ☆ Moe Moe Krew! ☆ ♡ ☆**

The comment every author hopes for, "LGTM" (a.k.a. "Looks good to me!") lets them know that you couldn't find any fault with the PR. Leave these emojis to let the author know they've done a **subarashī** job!

The logic looks good, but maybe there's some small syntax fixes or tiny updates that will make the code **utsukushii**!
